# React Native VSCode Snippets

Some bare-bones code snippets I use for React Native + [Unistyles](https://www.unistyl.es/).

- **`fcu.code-snippets`**  
  Typed React Native functional component with Unistyles. Includes a container View with style merging, children support, and a Unistyles StyleSheet with theme/runtime values.

- **`fcuvar.code-snippets`**  
  Same idea, but with minimal [Unistyles variants](https://www.unistyl.es/v3/references/variants) setup.  

## How to use

1. Copy whichever file you want into your project’s `.vscode/` folder  
   (or into your global snippets folder).  
2. Restart VS Code.  
3. Type the prefix (like `fcu` or `fcuvar`) in a `.tsx` file → expand → done.

## Prefixes

| Prefix    | Expands to                                      |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `fcu`     | Functional component with Unistyles             |
| `fcuvar`  | Functional component with Unistyles Variants    |
